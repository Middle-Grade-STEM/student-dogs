<div class="downsides">
  <h4>What are the downsides of a dog and are there ways to solve them?</h4>

  <p>Some downsides of owning a dog is that you might be allergic, your home becomes more messy, and finiancial burden. You might be allergic to dog hair when a dog sheds their hair
but to solve this problem you could easily buy a dog that does not shed hair. Your home is gonna naturally become more messy as a dog is gonna be everywhere and might even get things dirty.
In addition to that they might destroy stuff in your house or slobber on them. If you train your dog well though you will have less problems with you dog messing stuff up.
Finally getting a dog is a financial burden, its kind of like raising a baby as you have to buy supplies for the dog.</p>
